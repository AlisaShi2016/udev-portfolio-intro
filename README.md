# Portfolio

Today's goal is to practice using HTML and CSS by creating a personal website. Here are some ideas for a website, but you can make your website about anything you want:
* online resume
* about me page
* showcase for your projects/photography/art/ect

## Instructions

1. Fork the repository and clone it to your computer
2. Make changes
3. Use `git add .`, `git commit -m "insert message here"`, and `git push origin master` to update your changes on the remote repository
4. You are encouraged to keep on working on this website after the general meeting is over. If you have any questions during the week, please ask in the Slack!

## Host your page with gh-pages
